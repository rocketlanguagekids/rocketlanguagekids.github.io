subtitle: The Why, Where, and When of Rocket Language Kids Club
---

Rocket Language Kids Club arose out of our personal interest in having a Mandarin-immersion after-school care program for our son who is enrolled at Norma Rose Point school in Vancouver, BC.  

Our son had just started kindergarten at NRP.  While English was and remains our home language, our son learned Mandarin in bilingual daycare and from his grandparents. We were keen to continue his daily social Mandarin exposure so he wouldn't forget what he’d learned -- and hopefully so that he would become truly fluent over time.  Luckily, Vancouver and, in our case NRP school, were amazingly well-suited to activities that support Mandarin language development!  It’s was our hope that some other parents would also love to expose their kids to Mandarin in a play-based after-school club setting.

The immersive, play-based after-school club we have started will, like a YMCA Kids Club or UBC after-school program, run daily from 3:30pm to 5:30pm with paid adult Mandarin-speaking supervision and little formal pedagogical content.  The only "rule" is that the play and communication to and between the children take place in Mandarin.  We have rented space from NRP and manage this formally as if it were after-school program: Rocket Language Kids Club is a BC non-profit society, carries $5 million in general liability insurance, has hired well-qualified Mandarin-speaking staff and ensured that they have and maintain up-to-date CPR training, and have built a small team of dedicated parents who can help administer the program ensuring its continuation into the next year and beyond.  

Our club is inclusive – in theory welcoming children without Mandarin experience. But in order for the club to be operate effectively in the absense of formal language instruction, the ratio of children with Mandarin-speaking experience to those without is restricted to 80%+.  In the event of over-subscription, a lottery to allocate spots for children without Mandarin experience will be held.  

Reasons why you might consider enrolling your child in this program:

1.     Even if Mandarin is the first language in your home: We know from personal experience and anecdotal evidence that many children quickly rebel against (or lose interest in using) their native/home/first language after starting in an English-language school.  Providing a daily social environment where children play and interact in Mandarin helps to normalize the language, and reduces the likelihood of your child losing interest in their mother tongue.

2.     If your child speaks little or no Mandarin: Children, particularly at the K-2 age range, are remarkably plastic – as we parents see daily! – and in a full immersion environment (with native speakers and encouraged by supervision to converse in Mandarin) can pick up the spoken language naturally and quickly.  Also, English and Mandarin are arguably the two most important languages for children to be exposed to and learn today in order to be best prepared for the future.

Thanks for taking the time to read about our idea.  If you are interested, please write to us at [mailto:rocket.language.kids@gmail.com](rocket.language.kids@gmail.com).  

<!--, please let us know about the likelihood and timeline of enrolling your child, and if you’re interested in helping with any program administration (establishing the non-profit, accountancy and tax filings, or working part- or full-time to supervise the program). Although we’ve already had some success identifying staff, we’d still appreciate recommendations for Mandarin-speaking paid program staff (e.g., yourself or family members, a nanny/babysitter who might enjoy working with more kids, people with activities/teaching backgrounds, etc). General feedback about the idea is welcome too!-->
