subtitle: The Why, Where, and When of Rocket Language Kids Club
---

Rocket Language Kids Club is an immersive, play-based after-school Mandarian-language immersion club. The club meets daily from 3:30pm to 5:30pm and is run by paid, professional, adult, Mandarin-speaking teachers.  The only strict "rule" is that the play and communication to and between the children take place in Mandarin.  

Rocket Language Kids Club rents space from Norma Rose Point School and is managed professionally.  To whit, Rocket Language Kids Club is a BC non-profit society, carries $5 million in general liability insurance, ensures that its Mandarin-speaking staff has up-to-date CPR training (and more), and has built a small team of dedicated parents who help administer the program ensuring its continuation into the future.  

Rocket Language Kids Club is inclusive – in theory even welcoming children without Mandarin experience. But in practice, in order for the club to be operate effectively without formal language instruction, the ratio of children with Mandarin-speaking experience to those without is restricted to 80%+.  In the event of over-subscription, a lottery to allocate spots for children without Mandarin experience will be held.  


<!--, please let us know about the likelihood and timeline of enrolling your child, and if you’re interested in helping with any program administration (establishing the non-profit, accountancy and tax filings, or working part- or full-time to supervise the program). Although we’ve already had some success identifying staff, we’d still appreciate recommendations for Mandarin-speaking paid program staff (e.g., yourself or family members, a nanny/babysitter who might enjoy working with more kids, people with activities/teaching backgrounds, etc). General feedback about the idea is welcome too!-->
