subtitle: The Why of Rocket Language Kids Club
---

Rocket Language Kids Club is an immersive, play-based after-school Mandarian-language immersion club. The club meets daily from 3:00pm to 5:30pm at Norma Rose Point School and is run by paid, professional, adult, Mandarin-speaking teachers.  The only strict "rule" is that the play and communication to and between the children takes place in Mandarin.  

Rocket Language Kids Club formally rents space from Norma Rose Point School and is managed professionally.  To whit, Rocket Language Kids Club is structured as a BC non-profit society, carries $5 million in general liability insurance, ensures that its Mandarin-speaking staff has up-to-date CPR training (and more), and has a small team of dedicated parents who help administer the program ensuring its continuation into the future.  

Rocket Language Kids Club aims to be inclusive – in theory even welcoming children without any Mandarin foundation. In practice, however, in order for the club to be operate effectively as a play-based language immersion club, the ratio of children with significant Mandarin-speaking foundation to those without is restricted to 80%+.  In the event of over-subscription to the club, a lottery to allocate spots for children without Mandarin foundation will be held.  


<!--, please let us know about the likelihood and timeline of enrolling your child, and if you’re interested in helping with any program administration (establishing the non-profit, accountancy and tax filings, or working part- or full-time to supervise the program). Although we’ve already had some success identifying staff, we’d still appreciate recommendations for Mandarin-speaking paid program staff (e.g., yourself or family members, a nanny/babysitter who might enjoy working with more kids, people with activities/teaching backgrounds, etc). General feedback about the idea is welcome too!-->
