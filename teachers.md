       Hello, I'm Helen. I graduated with a Bachelor's in Chinese from Shaanxi Normal School school, and I later continued my studies and received a Master's in Education. I have taught at key middle schools in Xi'an and Beijing. After immigrating to Canada, I taught for a time at Mon Sheong Chinese school in Toronto. The key educational challenge that I face, with my students as well as my own son, is how, in an English environment, to keep them speaking, reading, and writing Chinese. In Rocket Language Kids club, we will use songs, poems, stories and games to explore the wonder of the Chinese language, helping the students discover both ancient wisdom and modern fun. Let's have fun learning together!

大家好，我是Helen,毕业于陕西师范大学汉语言文学专业，后又获得教育硕士学位。先后在西安和北京重点中学任教。移民后曾在多伦多孟尝中文学校任教。在教学生活中不断思考在大英语的环境下怎样让更多的孩子坚持说汉语，看中文，写汉字。Rocket language kids club就让孩子在唱歌谣，诵古诗，讲故事，做游戏中同孩子一道去探索汉字的奥秘，感受汉字所蕴含的智慧和趣味，从中享受和孩子一起成长的快乐!

Hello, I'm Tina. I have a bachelor's degree in linguistics and am currently enrolled in the Early Childhood Education program at UBC. I love interacting with young children and am determined to pursue a career in teaching. I had volunteered as a Mandarin teacher's assistant at Tzu Chi Academy Program and worked as a kindergarten teacher in Korea for a year.

您好，我是Tina，畢業於哥倫比亞大學語言系。我曾經在慈濟擔任過中文老師助教以及在韓國教書過一年。我非常喜歡和小孩互動，喜歡看著他們成長。這也讓我更加確定了我想要當幼教老師的意願。我目前在哥倫比亞大學就讀幼教專業，獲取幼師執照。
