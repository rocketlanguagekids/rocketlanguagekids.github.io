### Who

Children enrolled in grades between K-7 inclusive.  Mandarin language experience is required for at least 80% of the total club membership.

### Why

1.     Even if Mandarin is the first language in your home: We know from personal experience and anecdotal evidence that many children start to lose their native/home/first language after starting in an English-language school.  Providing a daily social environment where children play and interact in Mandarin helps to normalize the language, and reduces the likelihood of your child losing interest in their mother tongue.

2.     If your child is a heritage learner or even speaks little to no Mandarin: Children, particularly at the K-2 age range, are remarkably plastic – as we parents see daily! – and in a full immersion environment (with native speakers and encouraged by supervision to converse in Mandarin) can pick up the spoken language naturally and quickly.  Also, English and Mandarin are arguably the two most important languages for children to be exposed to and learn today in order to be best prepared for the future.

If you are interested in learning more or want to enroll your child, please write to us at [mailto:rocket.language.kids@gmail.com](rocket.language.kids@gmail.com).
