subtitle: The Who of Rocket Language Kids Club
---

We, [Donna Ho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donna-wood/) and [Frank Wood](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~fwood/), are the directors of the Rocket Language Kids Club BC non-profit society.

Rocket Language Kids Club arose out of our personal interest in having a Mandarin-immersion after-school care program for our son who was (and is) enrolled at Norma Rose Point school in Vancouver, BC.  

Our son had just started kindergarten at NRP.  While English was and remains our home language, our son learned Mandarin in bilingual daycare and from his mother and grandparents. We were keen to continue his daily social Mandarin exposure so he wouldn't forget what he’d learned -- and hopefully so that he would become truly fluent over time.  Luckily, Vancouver and, in our case NRP school, were amazingly well-suited to activities that support Mandarin language development!  It’s was our hope that some other parents would also love to expose their kids to Mandarin in a play-based after-school club setting.

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
