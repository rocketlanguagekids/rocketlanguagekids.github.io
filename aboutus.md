subtitle: The Who of Rocket Language Kids Club
---

We, [Donna Ho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donna-wood/) and [Frank Wood](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~fwood/), are the directors of the Rocket Language Kids Club BC non-profit society.

Rocket Language Kids Club arose out of our personal interest in having a Mandarin-immersion after-school care program for our son who was (and is) enrolled at Norma Rose Point School in Vancouver, BC.  

Our son is currently in kindergarten.  While English was and remains our home language, our son learned Mandarin in bilingual daycare and from his mother and grandparents. We are keen to continue his daily social Mandarin exposure so he doesn't forget what he's learned -- and hopefully so that he becomes and remains fluent.  Luckily, Vancouver and, in our case NRP school, were amazingly well-suited to activities that support Mandarin language development!  We believe that enough other parents have the same motivations and desires (and are seeking educational after-school programs well aligned with work schedules) so we decided to start a _nonprofit_ society to support this mission: Rocket Language Kids Club.

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
